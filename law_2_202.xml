  <section prefix="(a)">	The cost of new sidewalk construction or extensions shall be assessed at six dollars ($6.00) per front foot against the property abutting on both sides of the street. If there already exists a sidewalk on the other side of the street, the total cost of which was assessed against the abutting property, the owner of the property requiring the new sidewalk shall pay an assessment of six dollars ($6.00) per front foot, the remaining cost of the sidewalk to be borne by the City. If the City Council decides pursuant to §6-2014 that there is a public need for a sidewalk on both sides of the street, and no sidewalk assessment has been previously levied, the full cost of the second sidewalk shall be borne by the City. 
</section>
  <section prefix="(b)">
   <section prefix="(1)">	If sidewalk improvements are made simultaneously to both streets on which a lot abuts, assessment of the costs of the installations shall be based upon the entire frontage of one street (short side) plus the frontage of the other street in excess of one hundred fifty (150) feet. 
</section>
   <section prefix="(2)">	If the lot is already served by a sidewalk which meets all City standards, any improvements to another abutting sidewalk shall be assessed against the lot owner to the extent that the frontage to be assessed exceeds one hundred fifty (150) feet in length. 
</section>
   <section prefix="(3)">	If a lot fronts on an existing sidewalk which meets City standards and abuts at the rear on another street to be built or improved, no assessment shall be made if it shall appear that no reasonable subdivision of the lot can be made by which the new arrangement of lots will benefit from the new or improved sidewalk. 
</section>
   <section prefix="(4)">	If a lot abuts on a sidewalk to be built or improved but physical or topographic restrictions prevent reasonable access thereto from the lot, then no assessment shall be made. In the event that such a lot later gains access formerly though impossible to the sidewalk which was improved, no driveway permit shall be issued until the lot owner has paid a fee equivalent to the amount the lot would have been previously assessed. 
</section>
   <section prefix="(5)">	Sidewalk improvements within redevelopment areas as delineated pursuant to G.S. 160A-500 et seq., provided the cost of such work is exclusively paid from community development funds.
