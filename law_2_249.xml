Prior to being placed into service, all sewer main extensions and water and sewer service connections to the City's water and sanitary sewer systems installed by a private contractor shall be inspected and determined to have been properly installed by inspectors from the City's Public Works Department and the City's Public Utilities Department. A sewer main extension inspection fee of three hundred sixty-five dollars ($365.00) shall be collected by the City Public Utilities Department for closed circuit television (CCTV) inspection of each sewer main extension project at the time of permit issuance that is two thousand (2,000) lineal feet or less in length. Sewer main extension projects greater than two thousand (2,000) lineal feet in length shall pay an additional fee of twenty-four cents ($0.24) per foot for each foot greater than two thousand (2,000) lineal feet for the inspection fee. Sewer main extension projects which are determined by the City during their initial CCTV inspection to not be ready for inspection shall be charged a re-inspection fee equal to the initial inspection fee previously described, for each attempted re-inspection. 
A water and sewer service connection inspection fee of seventy-six dollars ($76.00) shall be collected for each water and sewer service stub.
