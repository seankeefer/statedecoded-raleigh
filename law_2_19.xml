When matters are placed before the City Council, the Mayor or, in his absence, such other presiding officer shall have the power to refer them to an appropriate committee. If two (2) or more members of the Council object to any referral, the Mayor or other presiding officer shall place the question to a vote. The issue for decision will be: &quot;Shall the matter be referred to the indicated committee?&quot; If the issue passes with five (5) votes, the matter shall be thus referred. If the issue fails to receive (5) votes, the matter shall remain before the Council. The matter shall remain before the Council until, by five (5) votes of the Council, the matter is referred or otherwise disposed of.
