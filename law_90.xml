If any part of clause of this act shall be declared unconstitutional, and if such part so declared unconstitutional embraces subject matter controlled and provided for by any law, public or private, in effect at the time of the adoption of this act, such pre-existing laws shall continue and remain in effect, notwithstanding any repealing clause contained herein.
