It is the purpose and intent of this article to assure that available water resources are put to reasonable beneficial uses to avoid depletion of the City water supply during a water shortage and to ensure that demand does not exceed the City's capacity for water treatment and distribution. This article shall be liberally construed to implement such purpose and intent.
