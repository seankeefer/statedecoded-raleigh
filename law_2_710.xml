Anyone denied a license or anyone whose license is revoked pursuant to this article may file, within thirty (30) days of such final determination, an appeal to the City Council. All filings shall be dated and submitted to the City Clerk. The City Council shall consider the matter de novo, and if after a review of the applicable testimony, facts, and code provisions the City Council determines that proper grounds exist for the denial or revocation of the license, the appeal will not be allowed.
