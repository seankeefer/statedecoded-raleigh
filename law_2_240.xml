Except for lateral water and sewer main extensions and replacements which are funded exclusively from community development funds and are located within redevelopment areas as delineated pursuant to Article 22 of Chapter 160A of the General Statutes of North Carolina, as amended, lateral water and sewer main extensions and replacements will be made by assessment of the cost thereof against property owners to be benefitted thereby in conformity with Article 10 of Chapter 160A of the General Statutes of North Carolina, as amended, and, if applicable, Raleigh City Charter, as amended, or both. The engineering department of the City shall determine which method of assessment authorized by G.S. 160A-218, as amended, would be most equitable to be used in an assessment roll, but any interested property owner may appeal from such determination to the Council. The City will bear the expense of resurfacing of the pavement when it is necessary.
