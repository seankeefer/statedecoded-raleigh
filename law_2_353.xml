A written warning will be issued for the first violation of §8-2175(c). A civil penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be assessed for the second violation of §8-2175(c) and a third violation shall result in a civil penalty of two hundred dollars ($200.00). A fourth violation will result in interruption of water service to the offending customer. The City will issue written notification to the customer and occupant of intent to interrupt water service and twenty-four (24) hours later will interrupt water service. If water service has been interrupted due to repeat violation of §8-2175(c), service will not be re-instated until the Public Utilities Director has determined that the risk to the City water supply has been alleviated or the Public Utilities Director is otherwise assured of compliance.
