After the taxicab inspector has become satisfied as to the qualifications of the applicant, as indicated on the fully completed application, and after an interview of the applicant, the taxicab inspector, in his discretion, after checking locally available information contained in the application, may issue a probationary driver's permit to the applicant, not to exceed sixty (60) days in duration, pending his receipt of an FBI report on the applicant. The taxicab inspector does reserve the authority to lengthen the probationary period if the driver's investigative results received gives the inspector cause for concern.
