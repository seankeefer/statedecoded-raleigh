 <text>
The City may suspend or terminate reuse water service at any time the reuse water at the terminal point of the City's treatment plant does not meet the requirements of the governing regulatory agencies. In such a case, reuse water service may be restored when the City determines that permit user will comply with all the governing requirements. Within thirty (30) days following the suspension of reuse water service, the reuse water permit holder may in writing appeal the suspension to the Public Utilities Director, who within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the appeal shall conduct a hearing. When reuse water is not available, the City may substitute potable water on a temporary basis at the discretion of the City. An approved air gap separation must be used in any connection for temporary potable water.
