  <section prefix="(a)">	When the basis of assessment is the front footage method and a duplicating water or sewer service is extended to a lot not at the intersection of two (2) streets but with adequate (eight-inch sewer or six-inch water) existing service, assessment of the cost of the duplicating service shall be limited to the frontage of the lot abutting the right-of-way or easement in which the duplicating service is installed in excess of one hundred fifty (150) feet. The exemption shall apply to lots having an existing adequate (eight-inch sewer or six-inch water) or greater size water or sewer service main or the right-of-way or easement containing an adequate size water or sewer service main crossing or touching the property subject to assessment. The exemption contained herein shall not relieve a lot from an additional assessment for the extension of an existing sewer line if the existing sewer line extends across only a part of the frontage of the lot and assessment has theretofore been made against only that part of the lot abutting on the existing line. 
</section>
  <section prefix="(b)">	Where one (1) or more water or sewer lines traverse a lot or tract of land and the method of assessment used is the abutting footage on the improvement, the abutting footage for each lot, tract or parcel assessed according to the assessment roll shall not exceed the straight line distance between the beginning point and the ending point of the line or lines. Provided upon the installation of a duplication service to a traversed lot or tract of land, an exemption of one hundred fifty (150) feet shall be allowed for the duplicating service pursuant to subsection (a) above.
