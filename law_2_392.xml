If any person violates any provisions of this article or any regulation, standard, rule or order duly adopted in furtherance of this article, the City may terminate water, sewer, and/or reuse water service to that property. Within thirty (30) days following the termination of reuse water service, the reuse water permit holder may in writing appeal the termination to the Public Utilities Director, who within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the appeal shall conduct a hearing. If service is terminated, the consumer shall bear the full responsibility of any costs or liabilities for reconnecting to the utilities. The City shall be indemnified by the violator or in the discretion of the City the permit user from all claims, damages, losses, or expenses, including federal and state civil penalties imposed upon the City, caused by the failure to meet the requirements of the governing regulatory agencies concerning the use and operation of reuse water or from the termination of reuse water service.
