 <text>
At all railroad grade crossings within the City where approved automatic electric signals have been installed, the railroad company or companies owning the railroad tracks shall at all times maintain said signals in good working order. If the signals are temporarily out-of-order, then the railroad company or companies shall within a reasonable time after such malfunction or immediately where notice of said malfunction has been communicated to the railroad companies have said crossing protected by a flagman who will give ample warning to persons using the street or highway of the approach of a train until such time the train has covered the crossing; provided, however, during hours of darkness, a flare shall be maintained at the crossing during the entire passage of the train. This practice will continue until the signal system is properly restored to service.
