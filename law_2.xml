The corporate boundaries of the City shall be those existing at the time of the ratification and effective date of this Charter and as the same may be altered from time to time in accordance with applicable laws and illustrated by a map on file in the Raleigh Municipal Building. In lieu of maintaining a written metes and bounds description of the corporate limits of the City, the City Council shall approve a map showing the then current corporate boundaries of the City and the electoral districts therein, from and after which time such map shall constitute the official map of the corporate boundaries and electoral districts of the City, as such map may be officially revised from time to time by appropriate action of the City Council. The Planning Director, in consultation with the Chief Engineer, shall draw the original map for City Council approval and shall revise such map as the City Council authorizes revisions thereto by appropriate action. From time to time, when additional territory shall have been annexed in accordance with law so as to become part of the municipal territory of the City of Raleigh, and from time to time when the electoral districts of the City shall have been revised and re-established in accordance with law, the official map of the corporate boundaries and electoral districts shall be revised accordingly and, as so revised, shall be presented to the City Council for appropriate action. Such revised map, when duly approved by the City Council, shall thereupon become the official map of the City of Raleigh and shall supersede all prior maps of the corporate boundaries and electoral districts of the City. All such prior official maps shall be preserved as public records and kept on file by the City Clerk, and shall be subject to public inspection during regular office hours. The latest official map, properly identified and bearing the certificate of the City Clerk evidencing its approval by the City Council and stating the date of such action by the City Council, shall be kept on file in the office of the City Clerk and shall be subject to public inspection during the regular office hours of the City Clerk's office. Copies of the official map reproduced by any method of reproduction that gives legible and permanent copies, when certified by the City Clerk, shall be admissible in evidence in all courts and shall have the same force and effect as the original map from which the copy is made.
