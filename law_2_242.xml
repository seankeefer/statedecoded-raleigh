When water or sewer mains exist but are inadequate (less than eight-inch sewer or less than six-inch water) for the system and are being replaced, property should be assessed for the difference in cost between the new cost of inadequate mains and for the size installed not to exceed the cost of six-inch water mains or eight-inch sewer mains.
