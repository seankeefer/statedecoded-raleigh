  <section prefix="(a)">	Under any reimbursement contract entered into involving a major main extension, properties within designated acreage fee areas shall be charged the standard City acreage fee provided in §§8-2092 and 8-2093 at the time service connection is applied for in accordance with §10-6081(e). As these acreage fees are collected by the City, eighty-seven (87) per cent of the funds shall be assigned to the same acreage fee area they were collected from in order to allow reimbursement of contract developers of major mains installed within that same acreage fee area. Opportunity for reimbursement payments shall be limited to a maximum period of ten (10) years from the date of acceptance of the improvements by the City, as noted in the reimbursement contract, and no longer. 
</section>
  <section prefix="(b)">	If more than one (1) extension of a major main or mains have been made, reimbursed acreage fees shall be paid to the developers making such extensions in the order that the reimbursement contracts are signed. The first contract developer must be fully reimbursed to the extent allowed by this article or the maximum ten-year limitation have elapsed before any subsequent contract developers receive any reimbursement. 
</section>
  <section prefix="(c)">	Beginning on the second anniversary date of reimbursement contracts, the remaining contract balance shall be adjusted to the same proportionate extent the City acreage fees were adjusted in the most immediately prior June. Adjustments shall not be compounded, and the actual contracted reimbursable cost of the installations shall be fully paid prior to the payment of any adjustments.
