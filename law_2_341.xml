Johnson Water Treatment Plant, Smith Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, Little Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant and/or Neuse River Wastewater Treatment Plant, which meets or exceeds the minimum quality requirements of the current North Carolina Reuse and Reclaimed Water Quality Standards. 
Conservation (or conserve). Conservation or conserve means any beneficial reduction in water loss, waste, or use. 
Conservation device. An approved water conservation device, properly installed within a private plumbing or distribution system, to improve water use efficiency within the City water supply system. 
Conservation program. A program that identifies the uses of water within residential users, industry groups, commercial and/or industrial applications, which focuses on BMPs to reduce the consumption of water. The program will be submitted to Public Utilities for review and approval. Each conservation program should be updated as required by the Public Utilities Director. All certified conservation users should be publicly recognized as water savers. 
Consumer. Any person, business, corporation, institution, resident or industry responsible for any property at which water from the City of Raleigh public water supply is received. In the absence of other parties or the failure of other parties to accept the responsibilities herein set forth, the owner of record of the real property shall be ultimately responsible. 
Distribution Uniformity (DU). A measurement to determine the performance of installed irrigation systems; expresses the uniformity of applied irrigation water over an irrigated zone; expressed as a ratio of the average of the lowest twenty-five (25) per cent of measurements to the overall average measurement, gathered through the use of catch cans, commonly used to evaluate the coverage of one or more sprinklers or drip systems. The equation is expressed by that of DULQ:  
VLQ = average of the lowest twenty-five (25) per cent (lower quarter) of catch cans measurements, ml. 
Vavg = average all catch cans, ml. 
Distribution uniformity as measured by the low quarter distribution (DULQ) is a common measurement of efficiency. This distribution uniformity is determined by the following: 
Evapotranspiration (ET) sensor. A sensor that reads current, local ET data from a server and then adjusts the irrigation system's run-times accordingly. 
Hand held hose. Any hose that is connected to the City's public water supply system and held in the hand during irrigation use. 
Hose end sprinkler. An irrigation device that is connected to the City's public water supply system and is not designed to be held in the hand during use. Examples are: single stream, multi-stream, and impact type sprinklers. 
Hydrant meter. A water meter specifically designed, fabricated and leased from the City of Raleigh Public Utilities Department for consumers to purchase water from the City from fire hydrants in accordance with the City's Hydrant Meter Program. 
Irrigation audit. The licensed irrigation contractor will follow the guidelines set forth by the Irrigation Association's (IA) Irrigation Audit Guidelines (found in the Public Utilities Handbook and at: http://www.irrigation.org) to conduct an irrigation audit. The overall system must maintain a distribution uniformity (DU) of no less than fifty (50) per cent, and the results of said audit must be submitted to the City for approval in the format provided by the Irrigation Association. The auditor should inspect the installation of the backflow prevention assembly, main line, laterals, valves, sprinkler heads, drip/micro-irrigation equipment, control wire, controller, rain sensor, timer or controller and any other water conserving devices, and should assure that the intent of the irrigation designer or consultant has been preserved. In addition, the audit shall also verify the installation of specified water management devices such as a rain shutoff device and/or soil moisture sensors. Finally, the irrigation schedule shall be evaluated to assure that the irrigation system meets the supplemental water needs of the plants without wasting water. Systems which fail to meet the standards of the audit will have a period of two (2) weeks to correct the problem or result in having their irrigation service interrupted. 
Irrigation system. Set of components which may include a hose, piping, fittings, sprinklers, drip tubing, valves, and control wiring connected to a water source or water distribution network which is used to apply water to residential or commercial lawns, landscapes or other areas. 
Licensed irrigation contractor. A licensed irrigation contractor is an irrigation professional, who has met a set of minimum standards specified by the North Carolina Irrigation Contractors' Licensing Board under Chapter 89G of the North Carolina General Statutes. 
Major water user. A water customer who uses one hundred thousand (100,000) gallons per day (GPD) or more per account as determined on either an annual or an average day during the City seasonal water demand period. 
Non-automatic spray irrigation system. Any installed irrigation system that is connected to the City's public water supply system and which is operated manually. 
On-site reuse water. On-site reuse water is effluent water from an individual on-site wastewater system which meets or exceeds the minimum requirements of the current North Carolina Reuse and Reclaimed Water Quality Standards.
